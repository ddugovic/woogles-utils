> ... In this notebook, I'm fetching some Scrabble game data from the website [Woogles.io](https://woogles.io/) and in the next two notebooks, I'll process the data to produce a clean dataset and then finally analyze it. My goal is to create an analysis notebook on top of a regularly updating dataset so I can check in on the most recent games.

> Woogles.io has a few bots that you can play, so I'm grabbing some of the most recent games from one of their bots: [BasicBot](https://woogles.io/profile/BasicBot). If you have an account with Woogles, you can replace BasicBot's profile with your own! To generate the Python code to make the request fetching the game data from BasicBot's profile, I used https://curlconverter.com.
